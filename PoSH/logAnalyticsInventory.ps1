.SYNOPSIS 
  Creates an inventory of Log Analytics workspaces deployed across a number of Azure subscriptions. Requires the Az.ResourceGraph PowerShell module. This needs to be installed
  separately (Install-Module Az.ResourceGraph -Scope CurrentUser). Additionally, the Az modules require PowerShell 5.1 or greater, so a PSCustomObject could also be used to 
  return the results to the output stream. This allows for multiple ways to save or output the results.
   
.DESCRIPTION 
  This script extracts all Log Analytics workspaces deployed across a number of subscriptions and stores them as a variable. 
  Then the script loops through each subscription and extracts specific information about each Log Analytics workspace: name, resource group, location, sku, permissions model.
  Afterward, the script creates a PS Object and sorts results on name.
  Lastly, the script exports all data into a CSV file for use.

# Exploratory queries
# Search Azure Resource Graph for all workspaces

# Store a variable array of all workspaces and run the variable to see all fields contained within the object.
$workspaces = Search-AzGraph -Query "where type =~ 'Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces'"

# Run these cmdlets to ensure you gather all the right fields to form the inventory report. 
# You will want the name, location, resource group, SKU, and features to ensure your Log Analytics workspace is designed correctly to meet the needs of the enterprise.

$workspaces.properties

# From there, you should be able to extract the right information by running the next two cmdlets:
$workspaces.properties.sku
$workspaces.properties.features
